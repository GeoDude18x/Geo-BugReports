**Describe the bug**
When starting the new Containment event in Rainbow Six Siege, a glitch occurs during the first few seconds of the round where the screen goes partially dark and doesn't move. This seems like a place where a cutscene might have been intended to play but doesn't start.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Steam and launch Rainbow Six Siege.
2. From the main menu, select the Containment Event to play.
3. Start a new round in the event.
4. Observe the issue at the beginning of the round where the screen goes partially dark and barely moves.

**Expected behavior**
Expected a cutscene or normal gameplay visuals to display at the beginning of the round. Instead, the screen partially darkens, indicating a possible missing cutscene or glitch.

**Screenshots**
Due to issues with uploading the screenshot to GitHub, it's not included here (Screenshot shows URL here). However, the screenshot shows the screen being unexpectedly dark on one side while the game's HUD is visible.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Steam last updated on: March 7th, 2024

**Additional context**
This issue has occurred consistently when trying to play the Containment Event, and it might confuse players, leading them to think there is a problem with the game or their graphics settings.

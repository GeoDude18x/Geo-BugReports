**Describe the bug**
Hoiking is a well-known bug in Terraria that allows players to move through solid blocks rapidly using a specific arrangement of tiles. This glitch has been in the game for many years and can be exploited to bypass certain game mechanics, which could potentially ruin the game experience for some players.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Arrange blocks in a jagged, tooth-like pattern.
2. Stand next to the jagged blocks and use a grappling hook or just walk into the blocks.
3. The character will begin to move or 'hoik' along the blocks, passing through solid materials.

**Expected behavior**
The player should not be able to pass through solid blocks without using designated game mechanics such as teleporters or the Rod of Discord.

**Screenshots**
Screenshot of the Hoiking glitch pastes a URL. For more information, search "Terraria Hoik" and it should come up with a Terraria Wiki about it along with the picture I was going to use.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Terreria Version: 1.4.5 (Last updated: February 2024)

**Additional context**
This bug is well-documented among the player community and is used by some as a feature to create fast travel systems within the game. However, for the sake of game balance and intended gameplay experience, it might be worth investigating whether this should be fixed or officially integrated into game mechanics.
